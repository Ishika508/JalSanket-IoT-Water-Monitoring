# Problem Statement

Household water contamination often goes undetected due to the absence of continuous and affordable monitoring systems.

## Key Issues

- Lack of real-time monitoring in overhead tanks and storage drums
- Manual and periodic testing methods
- Contamination detected only after health symptoms appear
- No early-warning system for rural low-connectivity areas
